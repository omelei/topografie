/**
 * The app asks nobody anything.
 *
 * This is the product's central claim and the stated reason the repository is
 * public, and until now it was a promise rather than a fact. A promise about
 * network behaviour is exactly the kind that breaks by accident: one webfont
 * link, one analytics snippet, one CDN import in a dependency, and a child's
 * browser is telling a third party which school-night they practised on. None
 * of those look like anything in review.
 *
 * So the test is not "we did not add tracking". It is: over a real run of the
 * app, every single request went to our own origin. That is the claim, whole.
 *
 * With one exception since ADR-116, and it is narrow enough to say in a
 * sentence: when a parent types a premium code, and once a week after that,
 * the code and a random device number go to the premium server — nothing
 * about the child. Every run here has a code that was checked in 2099, so the
 * app has no reason to ask, and this test still sees nothing leave. The ask
 * itself is tested in `premium.spec.ts`, against a server that is not there.
