/**
 * A module may colour exactly three things.
 *
 * Styleguide §B: the highlight on the image, the progress bar and the module
 * entrance. Not a button, not a message, not a table, and never the mark — the
 * dot is ink on paper or paper on ink in every module.
 *
 * The reason it is worth enforcing rather than agreeing is that an accent is
 * always the tempting colour. It is the one that looks like the brand, so it
 * creeps onto the primary button, then onto the number that matters, then onto
 * a badge — and each step looks like an improvement on its own. What it costs
 * is the thing the rule protects: a child learns to look for a colour instead
 * of for a word, and then the seventh module arrives and the colour means
 * something else.
 *
 * So: every use of an accent in the source has to be named here, with a reason.
 * Adding one is deliberate and shows up in a diff as what it is.
