/**
 * Styleguide §E as a test.
 *
 * §E names sixteen icons and says, in as many words, that it will not draw
 * them: what it fixes is a construction rule and a list. A list in a document
 * nobody reruns is a list that quietly becomes fourteen, so it is here instead.
 *
 * What this can check is the rule, not the drawing. A tick that looks like a
 * cross would pass every assertion below — that is what the design gallery and
 * a pair of eyes are for. What it does catch is the failure that actually
 * happens: an icon added later that quietly uses a different grid, a different
 * weight, or a colour of its own.
 */

/*
 * The heroes are not in here. They were drawn on this frame while they were
 * animals; since ADR-098 they are illustrations with a material of their own,
 * served as images, and a rule about one stroke weight and no colour is not a
 * rule they could keep.
