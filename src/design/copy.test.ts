/**
 * Two rules about words, checked rather than remembered.
 *
 * **Every visible string lives in nl.ts.** Not because a second language is
 * coming — it is not — but because copy that is scattered through components
 * cannot be read as a whole, and the register rules in §5.7 are about the whole:
 * one word for retention, one job for "score", nothing that praises the child
 * rather than the work. You cannot hold a tone of voice consistent across
 * twenty files if you can only see one at a time.
 *
 * **Some words are retired.** "Vast", "blijft zitten" and "beheersing" were
 * three words for one idea, two of them carrying school baggage a ten-year-old
 * hears before they hear the meaning — "blijft zitten" is being held back a
 * year. "Leuk", "spelenderwijs", "avontuur" and "plezier" are the vocabulary of
 * a product describing itself as fun, which is a claim the child gets to make
 * and not us.
