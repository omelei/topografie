/**
 * The tests that are coming, and what each one is about.
 *
 * There was one of them, and one is what a term is not: a child has a
 * topography test on Tuesday and a tables test the Friday after, and a block
 * that could hold a single date made them choose which of the two to plan for
 * (ADR-077). There are as many now as they want to type in.
 *
 * A date on its own plans nothing, so a test still carries its subject. That
 * is what turns the block into a plan rather than a calendar: the soonest test
 * decides what the front door offers to carry on with, and it is the one thing
 * on that screen which acts on what the child typed.
 *
 * Only subjects that exist may be chosen. Offering a test for tijdvakken would
 * be promising practice material for it, and ADR-037's rule is that this
 * product does not make a child a promise it has not kept yet. Klokkijken and
 * then woordjes were the example here until they were built; Taal is a subject
 * a test can be set for since ADR-118, which is the list doing its job.
 *
 * They live in `settings`, which is a key and a value: a fact about the device
 * the family shares, needing no schema change. The list is JSON in one row
 * rather than a store of its own — three tests is not a table.
