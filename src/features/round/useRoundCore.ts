/**
 * The bookkeeping of a round, once, for every module that asks one question at
 * a time on a stage of its own.
 *
 * ADR-092 wrote this down as owed: the tables and the clock each carried the
 * same hundred lines between composing a round and handing out its rewards —
 * the index, the phase, the counts, the combo, the lives, the clock, the
 * toetsstand, the session record — and a fourth module would have made it four.
 * What a module still owns is the question: which items, in which order, with
 * which options, and how an answer is judged. It hands the core a composed
 * round and a verdict per answer; the core does the rest the same way for all
 * of them (ADR-101).
 *
 * The map's round is not on it, and that is a decision rather than a gap. It
 * answers on layers, judges near misses and draws a mix across sets, and those
 * are threaded through its bookkeeping rather than beside it. Moving it here
 * would be a change to the most-used round in the product for no child-visible
 * gain.
