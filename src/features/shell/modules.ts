 * changes, which is the whole reason `--accent` is resolved from `data-module`
 * rather than named at a call site.
 *
 * `built` is not a feature flag. A flag hides finished work; this says the work
 * does not exist. It still decides what a module's address does — an unbuilt
 * one answers with "binnenkort" rather than a round.
 *
 * What it no longer decides is the rail. ADR-051 reverses that half of
 * ADR-037: the rail is the map of the product, and a child who can see that
 * clocks and flags are coming reads a plan rather than a promise. It was the
 * right call at one module and the wrong one at five, because a rail with two
 * entries hides the shape of the thing.
