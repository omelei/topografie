/**
 * The ways of practising a module offers, in order of weight, each with a face.
 *
 * This replaces `round/modes.ts`, and it changes one thing that file was
 * explicit about: **the clock and the lives are in the list.** They used to be
 * chips beside it, on the argument that adding sixty seconds to something you
 * already know is not a way of learning it. That argument is still true, and it
 * is now made by the order and by the line under each name — which is where an
 * argument belongs, because a chip made it in a way that cost a child the thing
 * K2 exists for.
 *
 * What it cost: a chip started a round on the spot. So the two heaviest ways in
 * the product were the only two that skipped the sentence saying what was about
 * to happen, and a child who pressed one never read "Provincies aanwijzen · 15
 * vragen" at all. Now every way goes through the same three steps — what, how,
 * start — and the start button says what it is starting.
 *
 * Six is the ceiling, and it is a drawing rule rather than a limit on the
 * product: past six the grid stops being one glance and a seventh way is a
 * scroll before a child has chosen anything. A module with more than six ways
 * has a question to answer about which six to offer, and it should have to
 * answer it here rather than quietly growing a row.
