 * carried the same progress dot and every region the same ruled globe, which is
 * eight tiles with one drawing between them.
 *
 * The drawings themselves are in `Icon.tsx`, built from §E's primitives. What
 * lives here is the mapping, and it lives beside the page rather than in the
 * icon file for the reason `MODULE_ICON` does: a component library should not
 * have to know what a werelddeel is.
