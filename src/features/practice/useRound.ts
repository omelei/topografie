 * One round of "wijs aan".

 * A round covers the **whole set** where the set is small enough to be covered:
 * all twelve provinces, all twelve capitals, all five islands. For a set that
 * size it is the honest thing to do — a child asked ten of twelve cannot tell
 * which two they were let off, and "ik ken ze allemaal" is what they are
 * working towards.
 *
 * Eighty cities cannot be one round. Twenty minutes without a stopping point is
 * not practice, it is endurance, and the child who quits halfway has learned
 * that the exercise is unfinishable. So a large set is sampled to
 * MAX_ROUND questions and met again next round, which is what spaced repetition
 * is for in the first place.
 *
 * The order comes from the Leitner scheduler either way, so the items a child
 * keeps missing come round first. Everything is written to the device as it
 * happens: a child who closes the tab halfway keeps what they answered.
