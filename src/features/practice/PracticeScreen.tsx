/**
 * The practice screen, following docs/leer.nu oefenkaart.html.
 *
 * Three arrangements of two things, at four sizes (K3). Beside the map where
 * there is width and a hand on a keyboard; above it when the tablet is turned
 * over and there is height instead; on the map when there is neither. The map
 * is the interface — it gets the whole stage rather than a panel in a page,
 * which is the single biggest difference from what a child meets on the free
 * alternatives.
 *
 * Feedback appears exactly where the question was, at every size, so between
 * K3 and K4 nothing moves except the words. On a phone that makes it a strip
 * lying on the map rather than a dialog: a round is never interrupted by
 * something a child has to dismiss.
 *
 * The ten dots at the top are the progress bar of §B and carry the question
 * number, which is why no counter says it any more.
 *
 * Three ways of answering share this screen. Pointing asks where something is.
 * Naming it is a different skill and usually the harder one, and it comes in
 * two strengths: choosing between four names, where the answer is on the screen
 * and the work is knowing which one, and typing it unaided.
 *
 * Typing is where ADR-017 shows up: a child who writes the name of a different
 * real place is not told they were right, and is not simply told they were
 * wrong either. Choosing has no such case — every name on the screen was put
 * there by us, so a wrong one is wrong — but it does travel to the map, which
 * is the same lesson by a shorter road.
