/**
 * The dot. One shape, and very nearly the whole product.
 *
 * It is the highlight on the map, the progress bar, the retention indicator and
 * the item status — and the half-filled dot is also the shape of the "Bijna"
 * answer state. It was the logo too, until ADR-108 gave the logo a shape of its
 * own; the logo has been Denker since ADR-154, and the dot has meant only "how
 * far along" ever since it stopped being a mark. That last overlap is not a
 * coincidence to be tidied away: a dot half full means "practised, not yet
 * certain" in the table on K9 and "nearly right" after an answer, and those are
 * the same idea. Which is why there is one component and not two that look
 * alike.
 *
 * Geometry, styleguide §A:
 *
 *   ring thickness   one twelfth of the diameter
 *   fill             from the bottom, as a proportion
 *   at and below 20  the fill drops away: a solid core with 1px of air inside
 *                    the ring
 *   below 16         solid, no ring at all
 *   in negative      the ring is 10% heavier, against reading optically thinner
 *
 * That is the only simplification allowed. Nothing else about the shape changes
 * with size, and it never takes a module accent — the dot is ink on paper or
 * paper on ink, identical in every module. What distinguishes a module is the
 * accent on the highlight, the progress bar and the module entrance, plus the
 * path behind the name.
