/**
 * The mark, on the one round that has earned one.
 *
 * Every round in this product is scored and every one of them is logged with a
 * cijfer on the front door. What no round screen has ever done is *give* a
 * mark, and the reason is ADR-053's: a mark is a judgement, and a round where
 * the app told you the answer half a second after every question is not a round
 * whose mark means anything about you.
 *
 * A toetsstand is (ADR-085). Nothing helped, nothing was corrected on the way,
 * and what came out the other end is a number a child can compare with the one
 * they will get at school — which is the whole reason for practising that way.
 *
 * Over what was answered rather than what was asked, the same as everywhere
 * else: a round stopped early asked questions nobody got wrong.
 *
 * A tile beside the round's other two numbers (ADR-112), so it stands inside
 * the result screen's `<dl>`; the sentence saying why it means something is
 * under the tiles, where the result screen puts its sentences.
