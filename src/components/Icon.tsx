/**
 * The icon frame, styleguide §E.
 *
 *   24 x 24 grid, active area 20 x 20, margin 2
 *   stroke 2, always — no variable weight, no fill except a solid 6px dot
 *     where the dot itself carries meaning
 *   straight ends, corners rounded at 2, circles fully round
 *   at 20px and below: stroke 1.5 and one detail fewer
 *
 * Icons are monochrome: primary ink, or secondary where they sit beside text
 * that already carries the meaning. An icon takes a module accent only when it
 * *is* the module — which is the module pictogram, not this.
 *
 * §E specifies sixteen icons and deliberately does not draw them: "Icoonvormen
 * zijn hier vastgelegd als constructieregel plus benoemde set, niet als
 * afgetekende illustratie." What it draws instead are four primitives — circle,
 * diamond, line, dot — and the rule that everything is built from them, "zodat
 * de set uitbreidbaar blijft zonder illustrator".
 *
 * So all sixteen are here, constructed rather than illustrated. That is not
 * guessing at an undrawn design (build brief §0.2); it is the drawn rule
 * applied to the drawn list, which is what the rule is for. An illustrator who
 * redraws them later replaces the shapes and keeps the names, the grid and the
 * weight.
 *
 * Two things the construction forces. Nothing here curves: the primitives are
 * straight, so a shoulder is a bevel rather than an arc, which is also what
 * survives being drawn at 20px. And no two icons may share a silhouette —
 * which is why the tables sign sits on a key rather than bare, since a bare
 * cross is already the drawing for a wrong answer.
