 * The days a child practised, laid out as days (ADR-110).

 * to be fair and not enough to draw a week: "5 dagen op rij" says how many, and
 * a child also wants to see which. Those days are already written down — every
 * finished round carries the moment it ended — so they are read back from the
 * rounds rather than kept a second time on the streak's row, where two records
 * of the same fact could one day disagree.
 *
 * Days, not rounds: four rounds on a Tuesday are one Tuesday, for the reason
 * `recordActivity` is idempotent within a day. And the same calendar day as the
 * streak's own, local and YYYY-MM-DD, through the same `dayKey`, so a round at
 * 23:59 cannot be Monday here and Tuesday there.
