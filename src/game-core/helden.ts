/**
 * Heroes, stars and chests (ADR-096, ADR-097).
 *
 * Ten correct answers are a star. Five stars are a chest, and a chest holds one
 * of the twelve heroes. Three duplicates move a hero up a reeks — bronze,
 * silver, gold, platinum, ultra. The level ladder stays beside it, counted in
 * the same answers.
 *
 * **Nothing here is chance.** ADR-096 made which hero a chest holds a draw;
 * ADR-097 reverses that, and spec §4.5 and ADR-067's first condition stand
 * again. A chest offers three heroes and the child turns one over. Until the
 * twelve are held the three are heroes this child does not have, so **every
 * chest gives a hero you did not have**: twelve chests, twelve heroes, six
 * hundred correct answers, the same for every child. After that the three are
 * heroes not yet at ultra, and the choice is which one climbs.
 *
 * The order the three are taken from is fixed and the same for everybody, so
 * **the choice changes when, never whether**: taking a favourite first shifts
 * the rest forward, and the child ends with all twelve either way.
 *
 * Pure, like the rest of game-core: it decides what a chest may offer and what
 * choosing one does, and it reads no clock, no store and no random source.
