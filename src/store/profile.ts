 * Who is practising, and the settings that belong to the device.

 * asked for so the app can greet the child by it, and that is the entire reason
 * it exists (ADR-008).
 *
 * There used to be exactly one per device. There are now as many as the family
 * has children (ADR-046) — `store/children.ts` holds that, and these two stay
 * as the front door for the screens that only ever want whoever is practising.
 *
 * The settings below are the device's, not a child's: which switches are on is
 * a property of the iPad in the kitchen, not of who is holding it.
