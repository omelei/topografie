/**
 * Asks the live site whether it is there, by name, over the network, from a
 * machine that is not the one complaining.
 *
 * Everything else in this repository proves the build is good. Nothing proved
 * the site was up. That gap is the reason an `ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED` on
 * www.leer.nu could only ever be answered with a guess: by the time anyone
 * looked the site was answering again, and no run anywhere had recorded
 * whether it had ever stopped.
 *
 * The error itself sits below the app. The browser opened a connection and the
 * other end closed it before one byte of HTTP came back, so no React and no
 * asset can cause it and none can fix it. What can be done is to look often
 * enough, and to write down what was true at that minute — the DNS, the
 * certificate, the bytes — so the next report is a timestamp and a cause
 * rather than a screenshot.
 *
 * What it checks:
 *
 *   - DNS. `www` is a CNAME onto the Pages host, the apex carries GitHub's
 *     four addresses, and both are asked for in both families: the address a
 *     child's browser picks is often not the one a person checking by hand
 *     sees.
 *   - The certificate on every address, and how long it has left. Also when it
 *     was issued: a certificate minted in the last day means the custom domain
 *     was taken off and put back, and the window while it is re-issued is
 *     exactly a closed connection.
 *   - The page, over every address separately. Pages answers from four edges;
 *     one of them being wrong is invisible to anything that resolves once.
 *   - The assets index.html asks for. A wrong base (BASE_PATH in the deploy
 *     job) serves 404.html in the script's place — status 200, content type
 *     text/html, and a white screen for the child. This is the check that
 *     would catch it.
 *   - The redirects: http to https, and the apex to www.
 *
 * `--dns-only` stops after the DNS, for a machine that cannot reach the site
 * but can still resolve it.
 *
 * A warning does not fail the run. Warnings are the things that are wrong but
 * were wrong yesterday as well; a check that is permanently red is a check
 * nobody reads.
