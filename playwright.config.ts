// The five sizes of the app design, because §D gives each of them a different
// navigation model and the difference between them is where layout breaks.
//
// 1366 is the Chromebook of spec section 8 and the size that must fit a whole
// round inside 768 of height. 1024 and 768 are the same iPad turned over, and
// they are not one case: landscape puts the vraagbalk beside the canvas and
// portrait puts it above. 393 is iOS and 412 is the Android delta, which is not
// a rounding difference — it is edge-to-edge under the system bars, a 48px
// navigation bar, and no back button of our own.
//
// WebKit for the iPad on purpose: an iPad in a classroom is Safari, and the
// layout problems only WebKit shows are the ones a school hits first.

   * Six sizes of forty-odd tests is two hundred and seventy runs, and a runner
   * has four cores. Left to Playwright's default of half the cores it uses two
   * of them and a green suite takes ten minutes; a broken one takes half an
   * hour, because every failure is thirty seconds three times over.
   *
   * With four workers a green suite is about four minutes, and CI divides the
   * six projects over three runners on top of that (see ci.yml). By project
   * and not by `--shard`: sharding balances on the number of tests, and a test
   * that photographs six screens is not the same size as one that presses a
   * button. Dividing the work is the only lever of the three that does not buy
   * speed by looking at less.
   *
   * `maxFailures` is the part that matters. A suite that is broken is broken
   * after a handful of failures, and grinding through the remaining two hundred
   * proves nothing the first few did not — it only decides whether the answer
   * arrives in four minutes or in twenty-five. It is four rather than ten
   * because it now applies per runner: ten each would be thirty across the
   * run, which is not "stop early", it is stopping three times as late.
